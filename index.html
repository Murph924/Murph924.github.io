    <p>Hi! My name is Daniel, and I'm an aspiring concept designer, experimental rock artist, and tennis amateur</p>
    <h2>GAMES! UNLIMITED GAMES!</h2>
    <h3>My top 5 favorite games</h3>
    <h4>Bloodborne (or any souls game tbh) </h4>
    <h4>Persona 5 Royal</h4>
    <h4>Final Fantasy 7</h4>
    <h4>Cyberpunk 2077</h4>
    <h4>Fortnite (Yes I am an avid fortnite defender) </h4>
    <h3>Why I want to work on games</h3>
    <h4>I want to be an artist and musical composer for games because storytelling and creating worlds has always been my favorite thing in the world. And at this point I think I'm pretty good at it, enough to go into it as a career!</h4>

    <h4>2D Metroidvania about ghosts and mortality</h4>
